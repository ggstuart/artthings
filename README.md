# artThings - The Internet of Art Things

The Internet of Art Things, or simply artThings, is an infrastructure for creating connected digital artworks. It allows artworks that use micro-controllers, computers and web bwowsers to exchange data to respond to sensors. artThings makes use of MQTT, a lightweight and flexible messaging system that works on many different types of device and network.

## Beginnings

The project began as a set of technologies used by artist Sean Clark to enable his digital artworks to communicate with each other. When looking for a communication technology that could work across multiple platform he became aware of MQTT (https://mqtt.org/). MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT).
